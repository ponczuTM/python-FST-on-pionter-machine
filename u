A binary tree has 1000 nodes, and the tree's depth is 28.
Every node is a number between -1000000 and 1000000.     
Every number that equals 0 was replaced by another.      

Every algorithm searched in this tree for 200 numbers.   
They used some memory to perform these operations.       
Here are the results:
FST: 652457, peak: 934597
BST: 640878, peak: 750175
DFS: 636486, peak: 745783
